# Angular 2 application
### Info
This repo contains a web application built using [Angular 2 framework](http://www.angular.io) 2.0.0.beta.7 and [mLab](http://www.mlab.com) APIs. This project was my Master's Degree thesis in [Computer Engineering](http://informatica.ing.uniroma3.it) at [Roma Tre University](http://www.uniroma3.it).
